# Team-Specific Commit Practice

## Exercise: Fix These Real Team Commits

Based on actual commits from our codebase, improve these messages:

1. **Current:** "ZBDEV-19516 - Modify zcmd customer:load to include option to skip token validation"
   **Improved:** _______________________________

2. **Current:** "imprv: Update to SASS"
   **Improved:** _______________________________

3. **Current:** "Merge branch 'develop' into feature/user-auth"
   **Improved:** _______________________________

4. **Current:** "ZBDEV-19517"
   **Improved:** _______________________________

5. **Current:** "misc fixes"
   **Improved:** _______________________________

## Expected Answers:
1. `feat(zcmd): add skip token validation option to customer:load command`
2. `chore(styles): update to SASS preprocessor`
3. `merge: integrate user authentication feature` (with proper body)
4. Needs context - should never commit with just ticket number
5. Should be split into specific commits based on what was actually fixed
